# WLLR Rostering Program

### Background

The WLLR is a steam railway in Wales (https://www.wllr.org.uk/). It is a charitable organisation run by (almost exclusively) volunteers, including the engine drivers and firemen.

In order to provide a fixed timetable with volunteer labour, volunteers provide their availability for driving and/or firing and this availability is matched to the requirements for the timetable. In the past this has been done manually; now it is done by this program.

### Using the program

The code can be run directly from the terminal or it can be packaged into a .exe and run independently (which is how it is currently being used by the roster clerk).

The WLLR rostering program take inputs from .csv files for:
1. the timetable by day, showing the 'colour' of the timetable for that day 
2. the crew requirements for each 'colour' on the timetable
3. each individual's availability 



### Code used

This program is written in Python, with the user interface developed in tkinter.
